- Add comments for complex logic
- Group related code with `// MARK:` comments

## Project Structure

```
TimestampConverter/
â”œâ”€â”€ Core/           # Business logic and data models
â”œâ”€â”€ UI/             # User interface components
â”œâ”€â”€ AppDelegate     # App lifecycle and menu bar
â””â”€â”€ Resources/      # Assets, plists, etc.

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Timestamp Format

1. Update `TimestampConverter.swift`:
   - Add detection logic in `detectInputType()`
   - Add conversion method (e.g., `convertFromNewFormat()`)
   - Add corresponding `DetectedInputType` case

2. Test with various inputs

### Modifying the UI

1. Update SwiftUI views in `UI/` folder
2. Follow existing design patterns
3. Ensure dark mode compatibility
4. Test on different screen sizes
